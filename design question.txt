Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.
.....Before discussing API response time standards, itâ€™s important to know that API response time can be measured in several ways. 
However, the two most common are average response time and peak response time.
Generally, APIs that are considered high-performing have an average response time between 0.1 and one second. 
At this speed, end users will likely not experience any interruption.
 At around one to two seconds, users begin to notice some delay. 
Around five seconds, users will feel a significant delay and may abandon the application or website as a result.


 Get the API with maximum average response time for each user.
........ Method of calculating metrics gathered by each API response time test tool
Tools Simulate the load and capture speed which can make a difference in the response time
Extra items recorded when monitoring user loads
Computing metrics gathered by each tool increases the response time due to high resource consumption.
The architecture of the two tools may be different

Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours.
......
The leaky bucket algorithm is most applicable in scenarios where, along with rate limiting, we are trying to do some traffic shaping.
